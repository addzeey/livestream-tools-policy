# Crumpet Clips — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2025-12-17

This Privacy Policy explains how Crumpet Clips (“Crumpet Clips”, “we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use our service, including any related websites, applications, and APIs (collectively, the “Service”).

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.

---

## 1) Summary (plain language)

- We store the identifiers needed to run the Service (like your Discord ID and linked platform identifiers).
- If you choose to link third-party platforms (e.g., YouTube/TikTok), we store tokens necessary to access the permissions you granted.
- If you verify an Instagram account, we store the Instagram username and a temporary verification code, and we check for that code on your profile.
- We use third-party APIs/services to provide the Service. Those services may process data under their own policies.
- You can request deletion of your data (see “Your choices and rights”).

---

## 2) Information we collect

### 2.1 Information you provide directly
Depending on how you use the Service, you may provide:
- **Discord identifiers** (e.g., `discord_id`) to associate data with your bot/user.
- **Platform identifiers** such as:
  - YouTube channel ID
  - TikTok username/open ID (or similar identifier)
  - Instagram username
- **Clip information** such as:
  - video URL
  - video ID (if provided)
  - clip title (optional)
- **Verification information**, such as a verification code placed in a social profile bio (Instagram manual verification).

### 2.2 Information we collect automatically
When you call our API, our infrastructure may automatically receive:
- IP address
- timestamps
- request metadata (e.g., route accessed, response codes)
- basic logs for debugging and security

We use this for reliability, monitoring, abuse prevention, and incident investigation.

### 2.3 Tokens and authentication credentials
If you link a third-party platform using OAuth, we may store:
- **access tokens** and **refresh tokens**
- token expiration timestamps
- the scopes/permissions granted (where returned)

These tokens are used only to provide features you request (e.g., retrieving analytics) and are stored securely (see “Security”).

---

## 3) How we use your information

We use information to:
- create and manage your Service account association (e.g., by Discord ID)
- link and manage platform connections you authorize
- retrieve and display clip analytics and metrics
- verify account ownership (e.g., Instagram bio verification)
- prevent abuse and maintain security
- operate, troubleshoot, and improve the Service

---

## 4) How we share your information

We do not sell your personal information.

We may share information in these limited cases:

### 4.1 Service providers and third-party integrations
We use third parties to provide core functionality, such as:
- **OAuth / Platform APIs** (e.g., YouTube, TikTok) when you link accounts and request analytics retrieval
- **Infrastructure providers** for hosting/logging/monitoring
- **Data providers** used for account verification and/or analytics retrieval when configured

These third parties process data under their own terms and privacy policies.

### 4.2 Legal and safety
We may disclose information if reasonably necessary to:
- comply with legal obligations
- enforce our terms
- prevent fraud, abuse, or security incidents
- protect the rights and safety of users or the Service

---

## 5) Data retention

We retain information for as long as needed to provide the Service, including:
- while your account/platform connection exists
- while clips and analytics snapshots are stored for your use

We may retain certain logs for a limited period for security and operational purposes.

You can request deletion (see below).

---

## 6) Your choices and rights

Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have rights to:
- access the data we hold about you
- correct inaccurate data
- request deletion of your data
- withdraw consent for connected platforms by unlinking them

Practical actions:
- **Unlink a platform** via the Service/bot integration where supported.
- **Request deletion** by contacting the operator (see Contact section). Provide the Discord ID and/or user identifier so we can locate your data.

---

## 7) Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including:
- restricting access to service infrastructure
- using secure transport (HTTPS) for network communications
- storing tokens securely, including optional encryption-at-rest when configured on the server

However, no system is 100% secure. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your own third-party accounts.

---

## 8) International transfers

If the Service is hosted in a region different from your location, your information may be processed and stored in that region. We take reasonable steps to protect data consistent with this Privacy Policy.

---

## 9) Children’s privacy

The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required by your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 10) Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we may provide notice by updating the “Last updated” date and/or by other reasonable means.

Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
